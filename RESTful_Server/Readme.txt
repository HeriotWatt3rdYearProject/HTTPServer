For my group - if you don't get this, come and ask me. When you rev engineer for UML or try to draw the class diagram you might need to discuss this with me

To other readers - this is my 1st attempt at trying to build an API to allow access to a database via web GET POST requests. 
The resulting system will be used with a javascript front end to visualise research data. This is part of my 3rd year project for my BSc Computer Science at Heriot Watt, Edinburgh.

It's work in progress!
